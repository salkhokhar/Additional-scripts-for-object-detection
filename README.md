### Introduction
I have been working on license plate detection, which is an object detection application. While working on this project, I needed a lot of scripts to handle the datasets, compare results and to do some odd jobs.  
This repo contains the scripts that were useful for me. The scripts are not well polished. That may be a task for another day.

##### Have fun!!!
